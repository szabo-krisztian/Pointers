# Understanding bytes in the memory

<img align="right" width="154" height="150" src="./pics/ram.png" alt="RAM">
Memory of a computer is any physical device that is capable of storing information whether it is large or small and stores it <span style="color:purple">temporarily (such as RAMs) or permanently (such as SSDs)</span>.

\
Memory can be either volatile or non-volatile. Volatile memory is a type of memory that loses its contents when the computer or hardware device is switched off.

## Units of memory

Binary code is how computers talk and represent information. Letters, numbers, and pictures…. basically everything you see on the computer (including this post) is made up of different combinations of 0's and 1's.

>Binary numbers are base 2 numbers, \
and have only two values – 0 and 1. If \
we look at a binary number like 101, then we can again assign column values as we did with our decimal number, but this time we use 2, and not 10 as the base.

\
A computer processor is made up of multiple decisive circuits, each one of which may be either OFF or ON. These two states in terms of memory are represented by a 0 or 1. In order to count higher than 1, such bits (BInary digiTS) are suspended together. A group of eight bits is known as a byte. 1 byte can represent numbers between zero (00000000) and 255 (11111111), or 28 = 256 distinct positions. Of course, these bytes may also be combined to represent larger numbers. The computer represents all characters and numbers internally in the same fashion.
